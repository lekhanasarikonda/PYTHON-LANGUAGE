 Why Learn Python?

> Examples of general purpose languages include C++,c#,Java,Javascript,Ruby,visual basics and python.They do not include declarative programming languages such as SQL or languages designed for solving domain-specific problems.

> we can use python for web development,data Analytics,data science,s/w development.

> C++ is a general purpose programming language with its roots in the C language. Even though python is also a general purpose, it is high level language, python is easy to read and understand.

C vs Python

![ca1a1507-74c8-42d8-9de8-5d12fe27dab5](https://github.com/lekhanasarikonda/PYTHON-LANGUAGE/assets/134198650/ee10d7ac-828e-4f8f-919f-0363eb94749d)

Python vs C Language:

Developer: 

> Guido van Rossum developed the python programming language,releasing the first version in 1991.

> Dennis Ritchie developed the C programming language and released the first version in 1972.

Ease of use:

> Python is considered easy to learn and one of the easiest languages to use.

> C has a steeper learning curve beacause it requires you to build many things from scratch and uses more symbols.

Language Type:

> Python is a high level general purpose programming language that gets translated into machine language using an interpreter.

> C is a mid level language that provides a bridge between machine code and high level programming language.

Programming Models:

> Python is a multiple-paradigm language that supports procedural programming,imperative programming,functional programming and object oriented programming.

> C is a procedural programming language.

Execution:

> The python language is an interpreted language,python code runs through an interpreter that checks the code while the program executes.

> C is a compiled language that converts the source code you write into machine code by using a compiler that checks all the code as it compiles,the code must compile
before it can execute.

Syntax:

> Python uses line breaks to determine a line of code and white space to determine blocks of code.

> C has a syntax that uses semicolon to determine lines of code and curly brackets to determine blocks of code.

Python vs C++ language:

> Python emphasizes simplicity and readability,while C++ focuses on performance and low-level control.

> Python is dynamically typed,while C++ is statically typed.

> Python has automatic memory management(garbage collection),while C++ has manual memory management it actually requires it.

> Python is an interpreted language,while C++ is a compiled language.

> Python has extensive libraries and frameworks for various tasks making it highly productive for rapid development. C++  has a more limited but powerful standard library.

> Python code is generally shorter and easier to write and understand than C++ code.

> Python is widely used in web development,data Analytics and scripting while C++ is commonly used in system programming,game development and performance-critical Applications.
> Pythons dynamic nature allows for faster prototyping and easier debugging,while C++ offers stronger type checking and catch errors at compile time.

> Python is beginner-friendly, while C++ is complex.

Machine code:
>It is platform dependent.
 
>It is the collection of 0's and 1's.

>It is understood by OS.

>Can be directly executed by the processor or the CPU.

>A Low level code.

Byte code:
>It is Platform independent.

>It is the collection of mnemonics.

>It is understood by JVM.

>Created after compiling the source code and executed by a virtual machine.

>An intermediate code.

Is Python Interpreted or compiled:
Many Books and Many python developers mention that python is interpreted. But that is half correct because python is first compiled and then interpreted.
The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus,many programmers believe that it is an interpreted language.
The compilation part is 1st done when we execute our code and then this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine according to the underlying platform(machine+OS).

Ways to Run Python code:

There are multiple ways to execute python code.

>Python command line

>Text Editor(Vs code)

>Python IDLE(also python shell)

>The Python interactive mode

>Python IDE(py charm)

Career Opportunities after learning python:

> Python Developer------>Python,Django/flask

> Data Scientist  ------>R and python

> Web Developer   ------>Html,css,Javascript and python

> Machine Learning Engineer---> Tensorflow/pytorch

> Test Automation Engineer -----> Selenium

> Data Analyst

Expression in Python:
In Python,2+2 is called an expression,which is the most basic kind of programming  instruction in the  language.Expressions consists of values(such as 2) and operators(such as +) and they can always evaluate(that is,reduce) down to a single value.
That means you can use expressions anywhere in python code that you could also use a value. A single value with no operators is also considered an expression,though it evaluates only to itself.

Mathematical Operators:
There are plenty of other operators you can use in python expressions,too for example,below table lists all the math operators in python.
 
Order of precedence:
The order of operations(also called as precedence) of python math operators is similar to that of mathematics(BODMAS).

>The ** operator is evaluated first;the *,/,//and % operators are evaluated next,from left to right;and the + and - operators are evaluated last(also from left to right).

>you can use parenthesis() to override the usual precedence if you need too.
